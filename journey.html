            <h3>Primary School</h3>
            <h5>2012-2015<br /><span class="smol">early days</span></h5>
            <p>
              In primary school, I used to play games on my iPad, which had long waiting times for items, and it was boring to wait. 
              I browsed the internet for ways to overcome this problem and found out about Jailbreaking. 
              At the time, I did not understand much but following tutorials got the job done. I found joy in "hacking"
              the games as I could get all the in-game items I wanted. I also modded some games with the help of online tutorials. I
              published a YouTube video on how to do it as well, and garnered over 70,000 views on that single video.
              Around 2012-2013, iPhones were still running iOS 6 and the user
              interface was getting old. iOS 7 was to come out with a new flat theme, which modernized the design. I could not wait as the
              design was so appealing. Hence, I searched for ways to change the theme and got the flat design before everyone else and it made 
              me proud. In 2013, I tried installing a custom ROM on an unused Samsung Galaxy S3. I followed tutorials but
              forgot to flash GApps, which resulted in the phone being unusable. I could have fixed the problem if I had a laptop and knew how to
              use ADB, but I didn't. A few years later, in 2019, I started flashing custom ROMs again, with more knowledge and a laptop.
              This was about all I did in primary school that was related to IT.
            </p>
            <h3>Secondary School</h3>
            <h5>2016-2018<br /><span class="smol">introduction to coding</span></h5>
              <p>
                In secondary school, I was in the Boys' Brigade and we never did anything related to IT in the CCA. In 2017, I was in my second year and
                our school had a learning programme where we were taught to program an Arduino Uno to display a message and blink the LED at different 
                intervals. However, I did not learn much as they did not teach us to code and merely told us to copy from the powerpoint slides. 
                At the end of 2018, I came across the Python programming language on YouTube and tried learning it, but was too confused and gave up.
              </p>
            <h5>Jan-May 2019<br /><span class="smol">continued coding</span></h5>
            <p>
              In 2019, my final year of seconday school, our school brought us to Ngee Ann Polytechnic's open house. Many of my classmates were having fun, and I did enjoy
              my time there, but I was also seriously looking for courses that I would be interested in (Context: up until this point I was only considering
              JC as I had no clue what course to pursue after graduation). I talked to some lecturers and the IT course caught my interest. A few months later,
              in April, I started picking up where I left off for Python, more determined this time. During this period, I was quite obsessed with coding and
              it was quite evident as I was writing code using pen and paper during lessons, when I had the time. My first "official" program was a basic graphing
              tool for quadratic equations and took me an entire night to make. My father offered to buy me a laptop as he saw my passion for programming which I am grateful
              for as the laptops at home weren't working.
            </p>
            <h5>June 2019<br /><span class="smol">website and workshops</span></h5>
            <p>
              In June I started learning HTML and CSS to build my portfolio website for the EAE. It took me many hours to make and was frustrating at times
              because some of the code just couldn't work! It was up and working, eventually. The website you're on now is the much better version.
            </p>
            <p>
              I attended two workshops hosted by Nanyang Polytechnic
              together with my friend in the second week of June. We learnt to use Android Studio to create an android app with minimal functionality (it had a single button which made
              some noise when clicked) as well as programming a Micro:bit in Python, which was a much better experience than "coding" the Arduino Uno back in 2017.
              It could play music, and I programmed it to play a song (which I sadly didn't record). 
            </p>
            <p>
              I also attended the Youth Cyber Exploration Programme with two other friends at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. During this four-day bootcamp, we were taught Python basics, some types 
              ofen cryption and using hacking tools in Kali Linux. There was a jeopardy-style capture-the-flag which I found fun, even though we didn't understand much. Later, we went for
              a central capture-the-flag where students who attended the same workshop hosted by the different polytechnics were selected to join. It was held at Cisco Systems Singapore. It
              was an enriching experience working with people from other schools whom I've never met before.
            </p>
            <h5>June-Nov 2019<br /><span class="smol">custom ROMs</span></h5>
            <p>
              Around this time, I started trying out custom ROMs on my Motorola Moto Z Play so that I could customise it to my liking and increase its day-to-day battery life. I also learnt
              how to install the Google Camera application, known as the best camera app on Android, but wasn't available on the Play Store for non-Pixel devices. IT made the photographs I took 
              look much better and even had a night mode which the default Moto camera didn't have.
              It was quite fun for me. There were times where I messed up (deleted the system image, which made it unbootable and I had to flash the image from my laptop via ADB) and was
              very stressed, but everything turned out well in the end. I learnt a lot about my phone and tried out many ROMs. My favourites are AOSP (stock android), AOSP Extended (stock +
              many features) and Pixel Experience (Google Pixel firmware basically, with added features). I use a Google Pixel 2XL now since the Moto Z Play broke :( but am not using any 
              custom ROMs since it would break online banking functionality. 
            </p>
            <h5>Apr 2020<br /><span class="smol">Linux, JS and this website</span></h5>
            <p>
              This was a very packed month indeed. I learnt about Linux and Javascript, and created this website from scratch.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tried installing Arch Linux on my laptop alongside Windows 10. I had learnt about Linux in June 2019 during the workshops I attended. I heard about Arch Linux in
              December 2019 but failed countless times trying to install it. I resumed later in April 2020, where I finally succeeded. I learnt a lot about my laptop, including the different partitions,
              how there is a system partition for the user and a boot partition for the boot manager where I installed GRUB2 (a bootloader that can chainload Window's boot manager) on and partitioning my laptop's SSD.
              I also learnt much more about Linux, how 'everything is a file' and basic commandline tools.
              I learnt how to build packages from git repositories on Arch Linux, which is done by using <code>git clone</code> and <code>makepkg</code>. 
              Twice, I accidentally deleted the entire Windows boot directory and had to boot into Windows installation media to fix it.
              It was distressing because I could not boot into Windows at all. 
              I was so used to the linux command line that I am now using Git bash as my default shell in Windows Terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I delved into the world of Javascript and used NodeJS to create my very own Discord bot using the Eris library. I learnt about callbacks, promises and async await.
              These tools are used since Javascript is a single-threaded programming language. Since there are many commands which may be added to the Discord bot, I learnt to modularise the project
              by creating a folder for the command files, and exported them using <code>module.exports</code>. The main file would import these files and on the event of a message in the channel, would
              check if it was a valid command. If it was, it would execute the command's function. I created a command, <code>.wotd</code> which grabs the word of the day from <code>dictionary.com</code>
              and sends it to the text channel where the command was used. I learnt a bit about HTTP requests and web-scraping during the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to recreate my website since the old one did not look very pleasing to me. For comparison, <a class="a" href="https://xaeiou.netlify.app" target="_blank">this</a> is
              the old website. I also wanted to add features like parallax scrolling and a much better theme. I'm using my favourite colour scheme, <a class="a" href="https://www.nordtheme.com/">Nord</a>, which I also use in VS Code.
              It took me many days and countless hours to make, but I am glad with the final result. The hardest part for me was the parallax scrolling. I spent many hours trying to understand the concept and when I got it
              to work, I couldn't click on hyperlinks and learnt that it was because of the Z-index of the different elements.
              <br /><br />
              <span class="smol">This is how I made the parallax scrolling effect:</span><br />
              I have one main wrapper <code>main-wrapper</code>, which contains three other wrappers <code>parallax-wrapper-front</code>, <code>parallax-wrapper-back</code> and <code>content-wrapper</code>.
              <code>parallax-wrapper-front</code> has normal scroll speed while the other two have slower scroll speeds. The three wrappers are stacked on top of each other by applying the <code>position: absolute</code>
              property to each wrapper, setting the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> values to <code>0</code>. The topmost layer is <code>content-wrapper</code> (so that hyperlinks
              are clickable, since hyperlinks that are in the back aren't clickable). The middle layer is <code>parallax-wrapper-front</code> and the last layer is <code>parallax-wrapper-back</code>. If there are links that I want
              to add, I'll use <code>content-wrapper</code> with an invisible background so that it doesn't disrupt the parallax effect. If you need help visualising, take a look at
              <a class="a" href="https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/demo3/">this</a>. I found it very helpful.
