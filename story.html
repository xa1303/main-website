            <h3>Primary School</h3>
            <h5>2010-2015<br /><span class="smol">early days</span></h5>
            <p>
              In primary school, I used to play games on my iPad, which had long waiting times for items, and it was boring to wait. 
              I browsed the internet for ways to overcome this problem and found out about Jailbreaking. 
              At the time, I did not understand much but following tutorials got the job done. I found joy in "hacking"
              the games as I could get all the in-game items I wanted. I also modded some games with the help of online tutorials. I
              published a YouTube video on how to do it as well, and garnered over 70,000 views on that single video.
              Around 2012-2013, iPhones were still running iOS 6 and the user
              interface was getting old. iOS 7 was to come out with a new flat theme, which modernized the design. I could not wait as the
              design was so appealing. Hence, I searched for ways to change the theme and got the flat design before everyone else and it made 
              me proud. In 2013, I tried installing a custom ROM on an unused Samsung Galaxy S3. I followed tutorials but
              forgot to flash GApps, which resulted in the phone being unusable. I could have fixed the problem if I had a laptop and knew how to
              use ADB, but I didn't. A few years later, in 2019, I started flashing custom ROMs again, with more knowledge and a laptop.
              This was about all I did in primary school that was related to IT.
            </p>
            <h3>Secondary School</h3>
            <h5>2016-2018<br /><span class="smol">introduction to coding</span></h5>
              <p>
                In secondary school, I was in the Boys' Brigade and we never did anything related to IT in the CCA. In 2017, I was in my second year and
                our school had a learning programme where we were taught to program an Arduino Uno to display a message and blink the LED at different 
                intervals. However, I did not learn much as they did not teach us to code and merely told us to copy from the powerpoint slides. 
                At the end of 2018, I came across the Python programming language on YouTube and tried learning it, but was too confused and gave up.
              </p>
            <h5>Jan-May 2019<br /><span class="smol">continued coding</span></h5>
            <p>
              In 2019, my final year of seconday school, our school brought us to Ngee Ann Polytechnic's open house. Many of my classmates were having fun, and I did enjoy
              my time there, but I was also seriously looking for courses that I would be interested in (Context: up until this point I was only considering
              JC as I had no clue what course to pursue after graduation). I talked to some lecturers and the IT course caught my interest. A few months later,
              in April, I started picking up where I left off for Python, more determined this time. During this period, I was quite obsessed with coding and
              it was quite evident as I was writing code using pen and paper during lessons, when I had the time. My first "official" program was a basic graphing
              tool for quadratic equations and took me an entire night to make. My father offered to buy me a laptop as he saw my passion for programming which I am grateful
              for as the laptops at home weren't working.
            </p>
            <h5>June 2019<br /><span class="smol">website and workshops</span></h5>
            <p>
              In June I started learning HTML and CSS to build my portfolio website for the EAE.
              This is the website, if you're interested. It took me many hours to make and was frustrating at times 
              because some of the code just couldn't work! It was up and working, eventually. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I attended two workshops hosted by Nanyang Polytechnic
              together with my friend in the second week of June. We learnt to use Android Studio to create an android app with minimal functionality (it had a single button which made
              some noise when clicked) as well as programming a Micro:bit in Python, which was a much better experience than "coding" the Arduino Uno back in 2017.
              It could play music, and I programmed it to play a song (which I sadly didn't record). 
            </p>
            <p>
              I also attended the Youth Cyber Exploration Programme with two other friends at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. During this four-day bootcamp, we were taught Python basics, some types 
              ofen cryption and using hacking tools in Kali Linux. There was a jeopardy-style capture-the-flag which I found fun, even though we didn't understand much. Later, we went for
              a central capture-the-flag where students who attended the same workshop hosted by the different polytechnics were selected to join. It was held at Cisco Systems Singapore. It
              was an enriching experience working with people from other schools whom I've never met before.
            </p>
            <h5>June-Nov 2019<br /><span class="smol">custom ROMs</span></h5>
            <p>
              Around this time, I started trying out custom ROMs on my Motorola Moto Z Play so that I could customise it to my liking and increase its day-to-day battery life. I also learnt
              how to install the Google Camera application, known as the best camera app on Android, but wasn't available on the Play Store for non-Pixel devices. IT made the photographs I took 
              look much better and even had a night mode which the default Moto camera didn't have.
              It was quite fun for me. There were times where I messed up (deleted the system image, which made it unbootable and I had to flash the image from my laptop via ADB) and was
              very stressed, but everything turned out well in the end. I learnt a lot about my phone and tried out many ROMs. My favourites are AOSP (stock android), AOSP Extended (stock +
              many features) and Pixel Experience (Google Pixel firmware basically, with added features). I use a Google Pixel 2XL now since the Moto Z Play broke :( but am not using any 
              custom ROMs since it would break online banking functionality.

            If you have no time to spare, fret not! I have a summary written here.<br />
            2012-2015: Jailbroke my iOS devices, tweaked the devices and modded some games. Failed installing a custom ROM.<br />
            2016-2018: Not much happened. Chanced upon Python, tried learning, was too confusing, gave up.<br />
            2019: Got interested in IT, picked up Python, programmed my own website, attended several workshops and succeeded in flashing custom ROMs.<br />
            2020: Successful install of Arch Linux after many failed attempts, started working on a Discord bot in NodeJS using Eris library (still in progress).
